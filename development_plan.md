# DialogLens Development Plan & Progress

## Project Overview
DialogLens is an AI-powered conversation transcription system that records multi-participant conversations via LiveKit, transcribes the audio, and provides speaker-attributed transcripts.

## MVP Decision: Egress-Based Architecture
After analyzing the PRD, we've chosen the **Egress-based approach** for the MVP because:
- Simpler initial implementation with proven patterns
- Better suited for compliance and archival requirements
- Lower complexity for error handling and recovery
- Provides high-fidelity audio recordings for future reprocessing

## Development Timeline: 10 Weeks

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
**Status**: Not Started

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [ ] Configure Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Initialize LiveKit SDK and test basic connectivity
- [ ] Set up cloud storage (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
- [ ] Configure development environment and tooling
- [ ] Design initial database schema for conversations and transcripts

#### Deliverables:
- Basic project structure with all dependencies
- Database schema migrations
- Development environment documentation

### Phase 2: Core Recording Implementation (Weeks 3-4)
**Status**: Not Started

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement LiveKit room creation and management
- [ ] Build Egress initiation logic for audio recording
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint for `egress_ended` notifications
- [ ] Implement secure audio file retrieval from cloud storage
- [ ] Build credential management system for API keys
- [ ] Create background job queue for processing

#### Deliverables:
- Working audio recording pipeline
- Webhook processing system
- Secure credential storage

### Phase 3: Transcription Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
**Status**: Not Started

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- [ ] Implement speaker diarization configuration
- [ ] Build transcript processing and formatting logic
- [ ] Create database models for storing transcripts
- [ ] Implement job queue for async transcription
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic

#### Deliverables:
- Full transcription pipeline from audio to text
- Diarized transcript storage
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Phase 4: User Interface & Access Control (Weeks 7-8)
**Status**: Not Started

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement authentication (Clerk or NextAuth)
- [ ] Build transcript viewing interface
- [ ] Create download functionality (JSON, TXT, PDF)
- [ ] Implement notification system for transcript readiness
- [ ] Add RBAC for transcript access
- [ ] Build conversation management dashboard

#### Deliverables:
- Complete user interface for transcript access
- Authentication and authorization system
- Notification infrastructure

### Phase 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)
**Status**: Not Started

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting (Sentry, DataDog)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Create user and API documentation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Conduct security audit

#### Deliverables:
- Production-ready application
- Complete test suite
- Deployment pipeline
- Documentation

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3
- **State Management**: Zustand or React Context
- **UI Components**: Radix UI / shadcn/ui

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Queue**: BullMQ with Redis
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
- **Authentication**: Clerk or NextAuth.js

### External Services
- **Video Platform**: LiveKit Cloud
- **Speech-to-Text**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (with diarization)
- **Hosting**: Vercel or AWS (EC2/ECS)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, Vercel Analytics

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Egress Storage Strategy
- Individual track recording for optimal diarization
- Opus codec for efficient storage
- 30-day retention policy for audio files

### 2. Transcript Processing
- Async processing via job queue
- Structured JSON storage with timestamps
- Support for multiple export formats

### 3. Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption for audio files
- RBAC with organization-level permissions
- Audit logging for all transcript access
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- [ ] Successfully record and transcribe 95% of sessions
- [ ] Transcript availability within 15 minutes for 1-hour recordings
- [ ] Speaker diarization accuracy > 85%
- [ ] System uptime > 99.5%
- [ ] Support 100 concurrent recording sessions

## Risk Mitigation
1. **STT Service Limits**: Implement queue throttling and multiple STT provider support
2. **Storage Costs**: Implement automatic cleanup and compression strategies
3. **LiveKit Reliability**: Add retry logic and fallback recording mechanisms
4. **Data Privacy**: Regular security audits and compliance checks

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Real-time transcription using LiveKit Agents
- Multi-language support
- AI-powered summarization
- Integration with productivity tools (Slack, Teams)
- Advanced search within transcripts
- Custom vocabulary and speaker profiles

## Progress Tracking

### Current Sprint: Planning Phase
- [x] Analyze PRD and define MVP scope
- [ ] Create technical design document
- [ ] Set up project repository
- [ ] Gather API credentials and access

### Next Steps
1. Finalize technical design document
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
